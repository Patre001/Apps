    <h1>Privacy Policy for the apps</h1>

    <p>This app uses various services for displaying advertising, analyzing usage, and ensuring technical functionality. The processing of personal data is based on applicable data protection laws, particularly the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) within the European Economic Area, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) in the United States, as well as the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD).</p>

    <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
    <p>
      Paul Trettin<br>
      Bodelschwinghstraße 36a<br>
      58638 Iserlohn, Germany<br>

    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Processing in the App</h2>
    <p>The following types of personal data may be processed during the use of this app:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Approximate location, used for location-based advertising and analytics.</li>
      <li>Device ID (e.g., advertising ID or IDFA), used for analytics and advertising purposes.</li>
      <li>Product interaction (e.g., clicks, menu navigation, gameplay progress), used to optimize app functionality and advertising performance.</li>
      <li>Ad data (e.g., which ads were shown and whether they were clicked).</li>
      <li>Crash data collected to identify and fix errors.</li>
      <li>Performance data such as load times or battery usage, used to optimize the app technically.</li>
      <li>Statistical data such as session duration, level progress, or gameplay behavior is collected (in anonymized form) to analyze usage and improve the overall game experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of this data may be linked to the device ID and may be used for tracking purposes, especially in connection with advertising via Google AdMob.</p>

    <h2>3. Use of Google AdMob</h2>
    <p>This app uses Google AdMob, a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, to display advertisements. Google processes data about the device, approximate location, app usage, and ad interactions. This data may be used to display personalized ads or to analyze ad performance.</p>
    <p>The app automatically transmits appropriate privacy signals (e.g., through Google's Restricted Data Processing or the IAB Privacy Framework) to comply with legal requirements.</p>
    <p>More information about Google's data processing can be found at:<br>
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Information for Users in the European Economic Area (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>Before processing personal data for advertising purposes, consent is obtained through the Google Consent Framework (“User Messaging Platform”). On iOS devices, Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt is also shown.</p>
    <p>Data processing is based on the following legal grounds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Article 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent)</li>
      <li>Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest, e.g., app security, error handling)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When data is transferred to third countries, particularly the USA, this is done with appropriate safeguards in place (e.g., Google’s certification under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework).</p>
    <p>Users have the right to access, rectify, delete, restrict, or object to the processing of their data, as well as the right to data portability and to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>

    <h2>Information for Users in the United States (CCPA / CPRA)</h2>
    <p>For users residing in California or other U.S. states with privacy laws, additional rights apply under CCPA/CPRA:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right to know what data is being collected</li>
      <li>Right to request deletion of personal data</li>
      <li>Right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal data</li>
      <li>Right to non-discriminatory access and use of the app</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Users can opt out in two ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>System settings on iOS:</strong> Under <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking</em>, tracking can be disabled for all or specific apps.</li>
      <li><strong>Within the app:</strong> The app automatically transmits privacy signals (e.g., RDP or IAB Privacy String) to Google to reflect the user’s choice.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For more information on Google's data processing and opt-out options:<br>

    <ul>
      <li>Identifiers (e.g., device ID, IP address)</li>
      <li>Usage data (e.g., app activity, ad interactions)</li>
      <li>Approximate location data</li>
      <li>Derived information (e.g., interest profiles)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information for Users in Brazil (LGPD)</h2>
    <p>This app complies with the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, LGPD – Law No. 13.709/2018).</p>
    <p>Personal data is only processed on the basis of legal authorization – in particular, user consent or legitimate interest.</p>
    <p>According to the LGPD, users have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to stored personal data</li>
      <li>Correction or updating of data</li>
      <li>Deletion or blocking of personal data</li>
      <li>Revocation of previously given consent</li>
      <li>Restriction or objection to specific data processing activities</li>
