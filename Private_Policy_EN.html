  <h2>3. Use of Google AdMob</h2>
  <p>This app uses Google AdMob, a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, to display advertisements. Google processes data about the device, approximate location, app usage, and ad interactions. This data may be used to display personalized ads or to analyze ad performance.</p>
  <p>The app automatically transmits appropriate privacy signals (e.g., through Google's Restricted Data Processing or the IAB Privacy Framework) to comply with legal requirements.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>When data is transferred to third countries, particularly the USA, this is done with appropriate safeguards in place (e.g., Google’s certification under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework).</p>
  <p>Users have the right to access, rectify, delete, restrict, or object to the processing of their data, as well as the right to data portability and to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>
