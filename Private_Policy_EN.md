## 2. Data Processing in the App

The following types of personal data may be processed when using this app:

- Approximate location is used for location-based advertising and analytics.
- Device ID (e.g., advertising ID or IDFA) is used to identify the device for analytics and advertising.
- Product interaction (e.g., clicks, menu usage, game progress) is used to optimize app functionality and ad performance.
- Ad data includes information about which ads were displayed and whether they were clicked.
- Crash data is collected in case of app crashes to identify and fix errors.
- Performance data, such as loading times or battery consumption, helps with technical optimization of the app.

Some of this data is linked to the device ID and may be used for tracking purposes, particularly in connection with advertising via Google AdMob.

## 3. Use of Google AdMob

This app uses **Google AdMob**, a service provided by **Google Ireland Limited**, to display ads. Google processes data about the device, approximate location, app usage, and ad interactions. This data may be used to show personalized ads or analyze ad performance.

The app automatically sends relevant privacy signals (e.g., via Google’s *Restricted Data Processing* or the *IAB Privacy Framework*) to comply with legal requirements.
